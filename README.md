# 👩‍💻 Hey, I'm Hannah! 
I'm a former Educator turned Software Developer in Los Angeles fascinated by the intersection between technology and public policy. I deeply believe in the power of code to transform and improve systems, and I love to nerd out about how digital tools can improve access to education, policy, and public services. 🌍

## Latest Projects

I'm currently working with Hack for Los Angeles on the 311 Data team, recently developed several pages for the Hack for Los Angeles website team, and completed several projects to graduate from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program
